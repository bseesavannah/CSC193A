    <p>I like <strong>cats</strong> and <strong>coffee</strong>. I think you could even say I have an <strong>addiction</strong> to both. If I could own more cats, I would, but I've been told that <strong>4 is enough.</strong></p>
    <p>There is a <a href=https://minicattown.org/ title=Mini Cat Town>cat cafe</a> where my brother goes to university that I want to visit.</p>
